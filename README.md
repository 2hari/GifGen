- Stripe
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI
- Zod (input validation)

### UPDATE :

The project can't be used on vercel. Vercel Limits backend endpoints to max 5 seconds of Execution time. The model deployed on Replicate takes 45+ seconds to generate output, so the serverless function times out. You can try running this app locally or it needs to be hosted on a dedicated VPC.
